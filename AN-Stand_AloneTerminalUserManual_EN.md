## Alphabetic Character Input (Letters)

In general the whole operation of the terminal is done with numeric characters accessible from the keyboard phone type. Occasionally you may need to enter any alphanumeric character (for example by entering a vehicle plate), on those occasions please follow the instructions below:

<table>
	<tr>
		<td width=50%>Image</td>
		<td width=50%>Description</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			<img src="Content/Images/standAloneTerminal/9.png">
		</td>
		<td> 
			In normal mode, the <img src="Content/Images/standAloneTerminal/16.png"> [ALPHA] key allows you to enter one of the two or more symbols or characters assigned to the keys on the keyboard  (note that this is normal and is specific to the application). <br>
			<br>
			Use the <img src="Content/Images/standAloneTerminal/16.png"> [ALPHA] key to enter up to 50 different letters or symbols using the following procedure:
		</td>
	</tr>	
	<tr>
		<td><img src="Content/Images/standAloneTerminal/10.png"></td>
		<td>
			Press the key on the keyboard the desired letter or symbol, eg for any of the following [2, A, B or C] press [2]).
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="Content/Images/standAloneTerminal/11.png"></td>
		<td>
			2) Press once the <img src="Content/Images/standAloneTerminal/16.png"> [ALPHA] key to display the first letter, Continuing our example, press the [2] ALPHA key and then to display the letter A.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="Content/Images/standAloneTerminal/12.png"></td>
		<td>
			3) If you press the <img src="Content/Images/standAloneTerminal/16.png"> [ALPHA] key again as many times as necessary they unveil the other characters or letters assigned to the key you pressed before ALPHA. For example, press 2 to display the number 2; Press the <img src="Content/Images/standAloneTerminal/16.png"> [ALPHA] key Alpha once to display the letter A, twice to display B, or three times to display C. Pressing alpha once again shows the number 2.

		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="Content/Images/standAloneTerminal/13.png"></td>
		<td>
			Note: If you keep pressing one of the keys on the phone type keyboard without using the <img src="Content/Images/standAloneTerminal/16.png"> [ALPHA] key, the same character repeats until you release it. For example, if you press 2 and hold it down, the screen will display "2222222..."
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="Content/Images/standAloneTerminal/14.png"></td>
		<td>
			If two or more characters are displayed on screen, pressing the <img src="Content/Images/standAloneTerminal/16.png"> [ALPHA] key changes the last character to the next letter, number or symbol on the sequence.
		</td>
	</tr>

			4. Report a sale without prior authorization.<br>
			5. To view the available balance before starting a transaction.<br>
			8. To perform maintenance tasks.<br>
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>

### Pre-Authorization:
 During normal operation the transaction is divided into two operations. First a pre-authorization is done from the POS to obtain the authorization to continue with the transaction and the amount of the maximum dispatch. After the dispatch has been done, the confirmation takes place, in which the real amount is reported. The pre-authorization involves communication with the central system and retrieval of the balance that it authorizes. Also, capturing this balance implies that it can not be used simultaneously from elsewhere. This means that ALWAYS, after a pre-authorization, should be an acknowledgment (Menu Option 2) or Pre Pend Delete (Menu Option 3) performed to update the balance in the central system. Start Pre-authorization pressing the option (1) on the keyboard and follow the instructions below:

<table>
	<tr>
		<td width=50%>Image</td>
		<td width=50%>Description</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="Content/Images/standAloneTerminal/19E.png"></td>
		<td> 
			Select option 1 form the menu to make a pre-authorization and start operating.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="Content/Images/standAloneTerminal/20.png"></td>
		<td> 
			The card that was assigned to the vehicle should be slided from top to bottom in the terminal slot reader with the magnetic stripe (brown or black) facing the computer screen. After sliding the card, the POS will request data about the dispatch to continue with the transaction.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="Content/Images/standAloneTerminal/21.png"></td>
		<td> 
			Select the number corresponding to the product that you intent to dispatch.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="Content/Images/standAloneTerminal/23E.png"></td>
		<td> 
			Once all the data has been responded, the POS will display the message "Processing..." while communicating with the central system to request authorization.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="Content/Images/standAloneTerminal/36E.png"></td>
		<td>
			If the transaction is unauthorized the system will respond with an error message indicating this while the terminal prints a ticket. In the example: "ID nonexistent". Please refer to Annex errors at the end of this document for details.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="Content/Images/standAloneTerminal/25E.png"></td>
		<td> 
			If the transaction is authorized the system will respond with a confirmation message like the example while the terminal prints an authorization ticket. The ticket indicates the authorized amount to dispatch for that identifier in that transaction.<br>   
			<br>Proceed with the dispatch following the indicated on the ticket.
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>


### Confirmation:
 Upon completion of the dispatch it is necessary to confirm the transaction in the system. To do this, choose option 2 of the main menu and follow the instructions. Start the confirmation by pressing the option (2) on the keyboard and then follow the instructions below:

<table>
	<tr>
		<td width=50%>Image</td>
		<td width=50%>Description</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="Content/Images/standAloneTerminal/26E.png"></td>
		<td> 
			Remember that the dispatched amount can not exceed the authorized amount in the pre-authorization.<br>
			<br>
			If you enter an amount greater than the pre-authorized you will receive an error message and the transaction will NOT be confirmed.<br>
			<br>
			Press the green button to re-enter the correct amount.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="Content/Images/standAloneTerminal/27E.png"></td>
		<td> 
			If the data entered is correct the operation will be confirmed on the server.<br>
			<br>
			The display will show the message OPERATION COMPLETED and the POS will print the ticket of the transaction.<br>
			<br>
			This first copy of the ticket is for the station and is normally requested to be signed by the Customer.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="Content/Images/standAloneTerminal/28E.png"></td>
		<td> 
			Then the POS will offer to print a second copy for the client. Press the green button to print or the red button to not do so.
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>


### Pre Pending Delete:
 If for some reason there has been made ​​one or more pre-authorizations and the corresponding dispatches have not been performed, it will be necessary to release the balance of these pre-authorizations to normalize the balance of the account. To do this press option (3) in the main menu and follow the instructions below:  

<table>
	<tr>
		<td width=50%>Image</td>
		<td width=50%>Description</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="Content/Images/standAloneTerminal/19e.png"></td>
		<td> 
			The POS will ask to present the identification that is associated to the pre-authorization to be canceled.<br>
			<br>
			Slide through the reader the same card you used to apply for pre-authorization.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="Content/Images/standAloneTerminal/30.png"></td>
		<td> 
			The card that was assigned to the vehicle should now be slided through the slot reader terminal with the magnetic stripe (brown or black) facing the POS screen.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="Content/Images/standAloneTerminal/23E.png"></td>
		<td>
			After reading the card, the terminal displays "Processing..." while communicating with the central systems to cancel the pre- authorization.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="Content/Images/standAloneTerminal/27E.png"></td>
		<td> 
			When the server has responded confirming the cancellation of the pre-authorization the screen displays a confirmation message. The balance of the pre-authorization is now available for use.
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>

### Sale:
 Under some circumstances it may be the case that the sale has already been made ​​and the dispatch was completed without following the normal flow of pre-authorization and confirmation. In that case, to enter the sale into the system, you will need to use option 4 from the main menu: SALE. It is important to note that when processing a sale the system will apply the same restrictions that had been applied in a pre-authorization, therefore, if you try to enter a sale for an amount or volume that is not authorized for that identifier at the time, the sale will be rejected. If this happens it will be necessary to contact the help desk to determine how to proceed with the sale. To enter a sale press option (4) in the main menu and follow the instructions below:

<table>
	<tr>
		<td width=50%>Image</td>
		<td width=50%>Description</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="Content/Images/standAloneTerminal/19E.png"></td>
		<td> 
			The POS will ask to present the identification associated with the sale to be informed.<br>
			<br>
			Slice through the reader the fleet card.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="Content/Images/standAloneTerminal/30.png"></td>
		<td> 
			The card that was assigned to the vehicle should be slided through the slot reader terminal with the magnetic stripe (brown or black) facing the POS screen.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="Content/Images/standAloneTerminal/23E.png"></td>
		<td> 
			After reading the card, the terminal displays "Processing..." while communicating with the central systems to report the sale.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="Content/Images/standAloneTerminal/36E.png"></td>
		<td> 
			If the transaction is unauthorized the system will respond with an error message indicating this and will print a ticket. In the example: "ID nonexistent". Please refer to Annex errors at the end of this document for details.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="Content/Images/standAloneTerminal/27E.png"></td>
		<td> 
			If the data entered is correct the operation will be confirmed on the server.<br>
			<br>
			The display will show the message OPERATION COMPLETED and the POS will print the ticket of the transaction.<br>
			<br>
			This first copy of the ticket is for the station and is normally requested to be signed by the Customer.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="Content/Images/standAloneTerminal/25E.png"></td>
		<td> 
			If the transaction is authorized the system will respond with a confirmation message like the example and will print an authorization ticket.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="Content/Images/standAloneTerminal/28E.png"></td>
		<td> 
			Then the POS will offer to print a second copy for the client. Press the green button to print or the red button to not do so.
		</td>
	</tr>

</table>

### Balance enquiry:
 This transaction indicates the maximum that can be dispatched in the next transaction to a specific identifier. Perform this query when the limits of the vehicle involved are unknown to avoid making multiple attempts of pre-authorization that can be denied. If the reported balance does not correspond with the amount the Customer believes he has, it is necessary to contact the help desk to determine how to proceed. To make a balance enquiry press option (5) in the main menu and follow the instructions:

<table>
	<tr>
		<td width=50%>Image</td>
		<td width=50%>Description</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="Content/Images/standAloneTerminal/19E.png"></td>
		<td> 
			Select Menu Option 5 for a balance enquiry and start operating.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="Content/Images/standAloneTerminal/30.png"></td>
		<td> 
			The card whose balance you desire to check should be slided throught the slot reader with the magnetic stripe (brown or black) facing the POS screen.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="Content/Images/standAloneTerminal/23E.png"></td>
		<td> 
			After reading the card, the terminal displays "Processing..." while communicating with the central systems to check the balance.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="Content/Images/standAloneTerminal/43E.png"></td>
		<td> 
			The system responds with the maximum amount available for dispatch. It is shown on screen and the POS also prints a ticket with such information.
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>

### Maintenance Menu:
 The Maintenance menu provides access to system operations that are not directly related to the operation of the same transaction. That is, operations that are not made with the same frequency as those for processing transactions in the system. This menu includes four options:<br>
<br>


1.Batch close <br>
2.Reprint last <br>
3.Void transaction <br>
8.System Configuration: From this menu option, system operating parameters are set. <br>

<table>
	<tr>
		<td width=50%>Image</td>
		<td width=50%>Description</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="Content/Images/standAloneTerminal/44E.png"></td>
		<td> 
			The POS will ask the user to choose one of the following options.
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>

### Batch close:
 This concept allows grouping a set of transactions for further analysis and processing convalescence. Usually, it is recommended to perform a batch close for each closing operating shift at the station. This way you can easily reconcile transactions that were paid with any of the means of payment processed by ATIONET. To do this press option (1) in the maintenance menu and follow the instructions below:

<table>
	<tr>
		<td width=50%>Image</td>
		<td width=50%>Description</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="Content/Images/standAloneTerminal/45E.png"></td>
		<td> 
			In order to proceed with the batch close, you require supervisor permits. Please enter the supervisor password.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="Content/Images/standAloneTerminal/23E.png"></td>
		<td> 
			The POS will ask the Central System to close a batch and process it. During that process, "PROCESSING..." is displayed on screen.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="Content/Images/standAloneTerminal/27E.png"></td>
		<td> 
			When the process finishes the POS displays a message indicating and prints the closure ticket.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="Content/Images/standAloneTerminal/48E.png"></td>
		<td> 
			The closure ticket includes a unique identification number generated by the server, the number of processed transactions from the last close, the total sales, cancellations and acumulated amount during the period.
		</td>
	</tr>

</table>

### Reprint last:
 If for some reason it is necessary to reprint the last ticket issued (typically when the printer paper is locked), this can be done from this menu. To do this press option (2) in the maintenance menu and follow the instructions below:

<table>
	<tr>
		<td width=50%>Image</td>
		<td width=50%>Description</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="Content/Images/standAloneTerminal/49E.png"></td>
		<td> 
			The POS will automatically print a copy of the last receipt issued. You can not re-print any other ticket.
		</td>
	</tr>
